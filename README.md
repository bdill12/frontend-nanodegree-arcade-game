To execute the game, open the page. froggor.html.

Use the arrow keys to guide the child across the pathway and to the water, where he or she is apparently safe, even though there are no bugs on the dry land, either.
The maximum score you could achieve is 8, but that would require no collisions with bugs, and traversing (the final round) a pathway with a dozen different enemies traveling at different speeds.

Once you have guided all 8 kids to the water, reload the game to play again.
